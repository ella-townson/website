          <h3>Science Internship | Paul Scherrer Institute PSI </h3>
          <p><strong>Details:</strong><br>Assisted a PhD students research into the Magnetic Short-Range order of the highly frustrated
system, MnWO4. As part of the course in Neutron Scattering at the University of Copenhagen, I spent
a week working in a team of Masters students. Tasked with developing a significant understanding
of the CAMEA instrument (a Multiplexing Spectrometer) and applying our knowledge of neutron
scattering. Additionally, researched the structural magnetic properties of the crystals to produce
informative plots, including successfully mapping the diffusive inelastic properties of the MnWO4</p>

          <h3>Banking Internship | Handlesbanken</h3>
          <p><strong>Details:</strong><br>Completed a graduate-level internship at Handelsbanken in Shrewsbury over an 8-week duration
learning about the localized banking the company undertakes, whilst completing a program being
trained to complete day-to-day tasks in the bank. Given the responsibility to manage individual tasks,
whilst also having the opportunity to spend time with each department within the bank, learning the
responsibility of each and understanding the inter-departmental dynamics. It was a great experience
where I was able to develop many skills, particularly customer service, teamwork and decision
