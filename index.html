      <!-- include a paragraph describing you/your interests hobbies --> 
      <p>
        A highly motivated, open minded and hardworking individual who is a consistent high achiever with a love for problem
        solving and taking on intellectual challenges.
        Currently, a Data Consultant at Accenture, I am enrolled in the graduate programme. I have graduated from thethe University of Bristol, studying an an integrated masters (MSci) in Physics with International
        Experience, for which I gained a first class honors degree. 
        This included a year abroad at the University of Copenhagen, which included modules with the Department of Computer Science (DIKU).
        I successfully completed a First Class Masters Project which explored using theoretical models (DFT+DMFT) to describe the structure of strongly correlated Nickel oxide.
        I have technical knowledge in Python, C ++, MATLAB and Java with excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to
        understand complex problems and create high quality, efficient and adaptable solutions. Enjoy working as part of a team to create and collaborate on innovative solutions.

                  <!-- short description  --> 
                  Assisted a PhD students research into the Magnetic Short-Range order of the highly frustrated
                  system, MnWO4. As part of the course in Neutron Scattering at the University of Copenhagen, I spent
                  a week working in a team of Masters students. Tasked with developing a significant understanding
                  of the CAMEA instrument (a Multiplexing Spectrometer) and applying our knowledge of neutron
                  scattering. Additionally, researched the structural magnetic properties of the crystals to produce
                  informative plots, including successfully mapping the diffusive inelastic properties of the MnWO4 crystal. </p>

                  <!-- brief description --> 
                   Completed a graduate-level internship at Handelsbanken in Shrewsbury over an 8-week duration
                    learning about the localized banking the company undertakes, whilst completing a program being
                    trained to complete day-to-day tasks in the bank. Given the responsibility to manage individual tasks,
                    whilst also having the opportunity to spend time with each department within the bank, learning the
                    responsibility of each and understanding the inter-departmental dynamics. It was a great experience
                    where I was able to develop many skills, particularly customer service, teamwork and decision
                    making.
